To reach the start of this climb, turn right at the crossroads just after the Red Lion on the
A616 and drop down the hill to the crossroads near the White Horse public house in Jackson
Bridge. Turn left at this crossroads to start the climb. It starts gently and passes over a
bridge over the stream and then the road bends right and starts to climb much more steeply
up to the church and turning circle for the buses. At this point the road is level and has
white hatchings painted on it, keep the bus shelter on your left and the turning circle on
your right then at this point you need to take the next left into Dean Lane. If you start to go
downhill you have passed your turning! The lane has trees to the left and open views to the
right. It is relatively flat at this point before it starts to climb again. When you reach the “T”
junction turn left for a couple of hundred yards and then turn right at the next “T” junction.
Now the road climbs all the way to the top at Flight Hill passing through a crossroads where
you have to give way. This section is quite hard as the gradient never really relents as you
reach up to 1300 feet above sea level.
