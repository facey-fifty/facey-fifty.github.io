This last climb of the book starts at the bottom of the “Big Valley” approximately two miles
from Huddersfield on the B6108, where there is a left turn down to Armitage Bridge.
I have left this as the last climb of the book as this is usually my last climb of the day when
coming home from a ride, as I live near the top, but I have extended it into the hamlet of
South Crosland just to round it off nicely.
Start climbing through the tree lined road passing terraced houses and then through the
village centre of Netherton where there is a wide variety of shops. Another three hundred
yards on and you pass The Beaumont Arms public house where shortly afterwards you are
going to turn right into Church Lane. This final section is where you will pass the church on
your right and a steep right hand bend with a phone box. You finally finish outside Fleece
Farm! If you have completed the climbs in order, congratulations and if you have done the
ultimate challenge of all the climbs in one go, Unbelievable and I say “Chapeau”!!
