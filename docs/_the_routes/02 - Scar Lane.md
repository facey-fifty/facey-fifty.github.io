This road has many name changes but heads up to Scapegoat Hill.

The climb starts right in the centre of Milnsbridge at the traffic lights. Climb immediately passing “Aldi” on your left, where the gradient is around 7% for most of the way to the railway bridge. Here the gradient eases slightly and continues in to Golcar village centre where the road is almost level. Pass the church and shops then the road bends to the left into Swallow Lane towards Scapegoat Hill.  Shortly after leaving the centre the road kicks up again increasing in severity around its junction with Slades Lane where the pitch gets up to 12% for approximately 300 yards until the roads starts to level out again and gives you a chance to look to the left and catch magnificent views over the Colne Valley. Continue up on to an oblique crossroad, where you will go straight across, but being extremely careful crossing as it is a fast road!! Continue up to the crest of the hill which is just after the junction with Pinfold Lane. If you wish to continue on you will be rewarded with splendid views towards Calderdale.
