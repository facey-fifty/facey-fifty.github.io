The start of this climb is from the same crossroads where the previous climb up Yew Tree
lane started, except you go straight ahead from Nields Road. As you can see from the height
gained, it is a testing climb, not so much the steepness, though 10% at first, but the long
grinding sections with a small relief in the middle. Once past all the houses and the good
views to your right, which hopefully you will have enjoyed, the incline slackens to around 5%
for quite a distance before finally kicking up to 11% as you get sight of the house at the end
of the climb which is the junction with Chain Road B6107.
