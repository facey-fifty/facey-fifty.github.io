This is the first of thirty climbs in the Holme Valley and it is a tough one to get you used to
this valley. The climb starts at its junction with the A616 Woodhead Road towards Holmfirth
and adjacent to “The Lockwood” public house. It starts off with a 13% section up towards
the village of Newsome. Until very recently there was a mill towering over the hill which
unfortunately has been burned down but the magnificent clock tower has been saved, so
look out for it! The road levels out in the village and your progress will probably be halted by
the traffic light by the church. Cross the lights and into Jackroyd Lane for the next section
which is a far friendlier gradient, until you pass the Baptist Chapel and a fabulous round
house, a converted water works building, where the gradient kicks up to around another
13%. When you reach the “T” junction with Ashes Lane turn right and follow the hillside
round until you reach the first left turn into Lumb Lane. Then approximately one hundred
yards later fork left up a narrow road which gives you the final approach to Castle Hill. The
Victoria tower was erected to celebrate Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee. This site is also
reputed to have been inhabited for over four thousand years but affords the most beautiful
views over Huddersfield and surrounding countryside. If the tower is open, which it is quite
often at weekends and school holidays, it is really well worth going up to the top for even
better views and to look at the plate describing the distant places you can see.
