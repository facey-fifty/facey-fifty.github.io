This climb can be found opposite the Londis shop, (see No 41) by turning left into Coop Lane
down a short but steep road until you reach a small bridge over the river and adjacent to a
mill pond and this is where your climb starts. It starts with a gentle incline past the houses
and the J&I School where the gradient increases slightly. When you get to a junction with a
large stone house directly in front of you and Acre Lane to your left you need to continue
straight up. You are now on the summer hill climb course used by the Holme Valley
Wheelers. The gradient really starts to increase and there is a really tight, steep left bend to
negotiate. You then pass the Vineyard on your left, no time to try the local wine just yet,
maybe on the way back down!! Keep pushing on as the gradient increases once more with a
narrow right hand bend taking you to the last straight section of some two hundred yards to
the finish at the “T” junction.
