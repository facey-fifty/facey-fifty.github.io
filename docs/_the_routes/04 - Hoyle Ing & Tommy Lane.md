This very short but very punchy hill starts at its junction with the A62 and is on your left approximately one hundred yards before the traffic lights at Linthwaite, which are close to the shops. It starts steep and you only get the slightest respite as really kicks most of the way to the top with an average gradient of 14%. Don’t try to attack this hill from the bottom as you will probably pay for it around the halfway point and there is plenty of steep climbing still to do. After the initial rise, past the houses on the left the road opens out and levels off very slightly. Once through this section you come to the Sair public house where you need turn off left up Tommy Lane, which is directly adjacent to the right hand side of the pub. The lane is very steep and narrow, but you continue up this lane until you meet the “T” junction at the side of the petrol station.

As a recovery you can always nip down again to the Sair public house for some well earned refreshments.
