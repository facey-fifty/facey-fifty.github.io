Enter Honley village centre from the A6024, continue through the centre and drop down to
the roundabout and fork left. Proceed along the road passing the large Methodist chapel on
your
right
and
then
taking
the
left
fork
into
Bradshaw
Road,
passing
the
Pink
Elephant/Foresters Arms on your left. Start the climb here.
All I have to say about this climb is that it is very difficult because you can see nearly all of it
laid out in front of you, just like a Roman road. As you are climbing you glance up thinking
you can see the top, only to have your spirits dashed, as you can only see a false flat!! You
now have to grit your teeth for the last four hundred yards. This is definitely a climb that
requires mind over matter!!! The average gradient is only 7% but it will feel a lot worse.
Enjoy!!
