As you can see from the map reference the road is only one hundred yards from the
previous climb and again starts very steeply under the same railway viaduct, (a very
impressive viaduct might I say) just a different arch. The climb incorporates the V9914 hill
climb course as used by the Huddersfield Star Wheelers, the only difference is that this time
you
go
a little
bit
further
and
finish at
The Rose and
Crown
public
house,
(another
opportunity to partake in liquid refreshments)!! Anyone would think I was a drinker! For
anyone that knows me that is totally untrue, but why shouldnâ€™t you take in some local
tipple?

The first two hundred yards are savage around 20% but then the next two hundred are
almost flat, passing the Junior School. Here is where you have the opportunity to recover
before the next gruelling challenge of 18% up to the small hamlet of Holme where again you
have a couple of hundred yards to recover before more climbing, but less steep this time,
around 8%. Once you get to the next flatter section,if you look up, you will glimpse your
finishing point of the pub ahead, as a beacon of hope, and knowing you only have a quarter
of mile to do. If you decide to partake in a refreshing drink stand in the car park for some
magnificent views.
