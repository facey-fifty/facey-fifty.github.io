Go down into Slaithwaite and straight across the roundabout, climb the slope and turn left
under the railway bridge and then pass the station and turn left at the “T” junction. Meal
Hill Lane is the first road on your right. The climb starts at this junction with Royd Street. The
first 100 yards are easy but then it starts to get harder with inclines of 13% for quite a while
between high bankings and walls before slackening around the Surat Road area, which is
where a road goes off to the right. This flat section is only for a short period before more
tough climbing including hairpin bends and 15% slopes. The last fifty yards are nasty to
there to play with your mind and legs!! Once at the top where it meets Moor Side Lane you
will know you have tackled a hard climb. Now catch your breath and look back and take in
the views, glorious!!
