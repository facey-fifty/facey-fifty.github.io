This is a bruising and again a classic Colne Valley climb in that there are hairpin bends with
steep inside corners and plenty of hard slog! A large part of this climb was used by the 2015
edition of the Tour de Yorkshire; the only difference is that they turned left at the first
crossroad at one mile onto Waller Clough on your left. If you wish to try the “Strava” section
for the tour, turn left and follow the road up to the “T” junction of Rochdale Road.
To find this climb turn down off the A62 into Slaithwaite, turn right at roundabout and
follow the road and under the railway viaduct. So the climb starts just after the Swan public
house at Crimble just after the railway viaduct. It follows Clough Road all the way to the top
at Scapegoat Hill, though the road name changes to Slaithwaite Gate at the third crossroads.
For the first mile the gradient never slackens to less than 10% except for a very tiny stretch
at around half a mile where it gets as low as 4%. Just as you are coming up to the mile mark
the road steepens again to around 13% and then after the first crossroad it almost levels out
briefly before the final slog up to Scapegoat Hill where you finish at the Junction of High
Street and Halifax Road. Here you will receive some of the most magnificent views.
