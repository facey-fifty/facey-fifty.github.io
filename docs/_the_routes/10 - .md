This  road  can  be  quite difficult  to  find so  be  careful  in  finding  it.  Proceed  on  Manchester Road  out  of  Slaithwaite  in  a  SW  direction  towards  Marsden  and  after  passing  the  zebra crossing,  which  is  shortly  after  passing  Varley  Road,  take  the  next  left  into  Nields  Road. Proceed on Nields Road past the Junior School to a small crossroads. At this crossroads turn left up the steep hill which is where you start the climb up Yew Tree Lane. The first section until you come to the small hamlet of Tanners is very steep and very narrow. Unfortunately if you meet any vehicle on this road you will end up having to stop, turn round and go back down to the start to allow it to pass!!! Ignore the road to the left at Tanners and keep going straight  on  into  Lane  and  Dowry  Road  which  can  be  very  rough  and  a  test  of  your  bike handling skills, especially when you come to a very sharp steep left turn up Delves Gate. The road then really flattens out towards the top with good views to be had. The finish is at the “T” junction with the B6107 and the site of the old White House public house now houses.
