Start this climb where the road junction and the pedestrian crossing are adjacent to each
other on the main road to New Mill when leaving Honley on the A616.
The climb is a nice gentle climb, nowhere is it steeper than 10%, up past the High School and
then there are several sweeping bends before it levels out on to a short flat section before
the final ascent where the gradient is similar to the early sections. Finish the climb at the “T”
junction where there are good views again of Castle Hill and arable land.
