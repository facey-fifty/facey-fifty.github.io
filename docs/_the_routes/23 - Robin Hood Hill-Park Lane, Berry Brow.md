and some three hundred yards after the aforementioned Laxmi restaurant. The first section
is up Robin Hood Hill where the gradient is between 6% and 9%. Take the first left up Park
lane where the gradient is a bit more severe especially on the first left hand bend where it is

climb opens out you get views over the beautiful countryside and Castle Hill. The finish is at
the “T” junction at Stirley Hill.
