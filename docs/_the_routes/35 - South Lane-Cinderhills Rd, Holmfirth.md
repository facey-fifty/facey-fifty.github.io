These next three climbs all start within a few yards of each other and they are right in the
centre of Holmfirth. Proceed down Victoria Street from the traffic lights and you need to
turn between the two pedestrian crossings up Dunford Road (which is in front of you, not
the right turn) and then immediately fork left up the very steep and narrow South Lane
which keeps to a very constant 11% to 13% gradient up the narrowest and roughest section.
This is one tough climb for the majority of the way but you are rewarded with wonderful
examples of old stone cottages, on either side, as you pass through the tight right hand
bend just before the flat section. Once on the flat with side roads, ignore these and keep
straight on and then it rises gently to the top where Stake Lane Bank comes in from your left
and this is the finishing point.
