This climb starts at the Fall Lane roundabout, turn left off the A62 Manchester Road just
after the Mountain Rescue station in Marsden which is fifty yards past the New Inn public
house.
This climb never relents and can be very exposed to the elements especially the wind. The
climb starts by passing John Edward Crowther’s mill, which in its heyday employed 3000
workers and was one of the biggest mills in Europe. Those days are long gone and it is a
sorry sight to see it in its present state. You push on through the houses and on up to the
Golf Course and Cricket club where a long straight beckons you into the moorland where no
doubt you will encounter sheep on or even in the middle of the road! A false flat comes into
view as you cross the cattle grid which shakes and rattles your teeth and knocks your
rhythm out of sync. Keep plugging away because the crest, which isn’t far away, just never
seems to come into view but eventually you will see a small standing stone on your right
and that signifies the finish line. The part of the climb from the Cricket Club lower entrance
to the finish is used by the Huddersfield Star wheelers as one of their summer hill climbs,
this one is for ladies only.
