Starting point is the same as the previous climb. After doing the short climb previously this is
again another of those difficult climbs in that is longer and a fairly constant gradient where
the wind can be a big factor. It will be a side wind coming straight off the moors. The road
starts by passing houses and then coming to an awkward angled crossroad (look out for the
wooden carving in a garden here), give way and then start the long grind against gravity.
The woods with golf course are on your left and wide open countryside to your right, where
over the last ten years a lot of trees have been planted at low levels. Go straight through the
crossroads and continue to slog up the hill. Once at the top where you will come to “The
Ford Inn” where your struggles will finish. Drink anyone?
