This is the first climb of twenty in the Colne Valley and it is a nice short but tough climb up the hillside above Milnsbridge where until recently you could take in views, now blocked by trees, of the industrial area that was predominately woollen mills which brought great prosperity to the area with some magnificent architecture. Now you have to wait until you start climb No2 before you get these sights.

The climb starts at its junction with the A62 Manchester Road and is very steep at first around 13% until the right hand bend where it eases very slightly. The road continues straight up before it bends slightly to the left and then kicks up again towards the top with a very tight and steep left hand bend approximately 100 yards from the top.
