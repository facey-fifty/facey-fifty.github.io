To find this climb follow the instructions for No 6 and then turn right as soon as the road bear left and rises up hill into Chapel Hill.

The climb starts at its junction with Causeway Side and passes the Linthwaite primary school on your right before sweeping right passing the Methodist Chapel on your left where the road levels off before starting to ramp up slowly through the Pog Hall area. Here the road bears left up Upper Clough Road. The incline gets steeper as you pass the terraced cottages. The road levels out as you pass the playing fields on your right with a final kick up to the “T” junction just below the Bulls Head public house, where once again you may partake in some liquid refreshment if you so desire!
