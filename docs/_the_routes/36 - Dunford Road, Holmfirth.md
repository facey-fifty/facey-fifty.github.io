Find this climb as described in No35) though this time you are going to continue up Dunford
Road for 1.5 miles, passing the famous yoghurt making Longley Farm very close to the top.
This has basically two sections to it in that the first half is generally steeper than the second
half but only maxes out at 9% before slackening to 6% for the long straight to the turn off
for Longley Farm. It then rises again for the last few hundred yards where you eventually
reach the renamed Algy Arms pub. Time for a pint? After the drink, nip back down into
Holmfirth ready for the next climb or walk around Holmfirth famed for the “Last of the
Summer Wine” television show.
