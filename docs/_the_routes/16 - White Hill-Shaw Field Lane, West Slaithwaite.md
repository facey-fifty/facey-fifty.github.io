The climb can be found off the A62 at West Slaithwaite by turning down West Slaithwaite
Road, approximately 1.1 miles SW of Slaithwaite opposite what used to be a petrol station.
Follow this road over the river and canal bridges and take the first road turning on your
right. Yes you guessed it straight up steeply under yet another railway bridge!!
The first two hundred yards are very steep at 18% and the surface can be quite poor if the
weather conditions are not good. Once you get to the right hand bend, the gradient
becomes friendlier for a while but then as you would expect it rises steeply to 15% again.

Towards the top the surface is not great, again!! The road sweeps round to the left behind a
house and finishes at the “T” junction with Holme Lane a short distance below the Rose and
Crown pub. I am not going to mention getting a drink!! If you do all the climbs out of
Slaithwaite and the ones from West Slaithwaite all in one go, you will definitely need a drink
at the end and I think you will have some very tired legs. Actually the next climb finishes at
the rose and Crown pub!!
