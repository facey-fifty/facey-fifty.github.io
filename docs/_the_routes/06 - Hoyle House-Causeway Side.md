This climb starts with its junction with the A62 Manchester Road on your left just after the pedestrian crossing as you are leaving the shops in Linthwaite. The first section is almost flat until you turn left at the bend. Then the road starts to go up and climbs at a fairly regular incline until after another left hand bend where it gradually continues to increase in intensity up to the top at a “T” junction directly opposite the Colne Valley High School. Now is the time to trundle back down to the hill to the last right hand bend where the road flattens out, and take the road to the left to start the next climb!!
