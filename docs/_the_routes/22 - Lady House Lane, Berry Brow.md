To find the start of this climb turn left off the A616 at Berry Brow, where the Laxmi Indian
restaurant is sited at a crossroad where there is also a pedestrian crossing. Climb up
Waingate and forty yards after passing under the railway arch turn right up Lady House
Lane, keeping the football pitch on your right. Only the first part of this climb is steep
around 11% so once you have reached a fairly sharp left hand bend you have cracked it. You
will get glimpses of Castle Hill now and again as the road contours around the hillside and
some good views of Newsome on your way up. The Climb finishes when you reach the “T”
junction opposite the Baptist chapel that you passed when you do the Castle Hill climb!
