Start the climb at the traffic lights on the A62 between Cowlersley and Milnsbridge shortly after the petrol station. This climb keeps a fairly constant gradient, around 6% through Cowlersley and starts to level once you approach Linthwaite where you have a pleasant respite with great views to your right. You pass the cricket club, church and the Alma pub before passing the large Colne Valley high School on your left, where yours truly attended!! A few hundred yards later the hill kicks up again onto a plateau, often very windswept, before finally reaching the “T” junction, just below the “Bulls Head” public house, which is the finish line for this climb.

All in all this is a satisfying climb as it isn’t too steep but fairly consistent with the occasionally kick up but with plenty of views to keep you in good spirits.
