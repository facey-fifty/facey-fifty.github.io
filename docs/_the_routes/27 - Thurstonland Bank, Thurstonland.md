To find this climb just keep going along the A616 New Mill Rd past the previous three climbs
and up a small incline. At the top of this incline, Thurstonland Bank is on your left. If you
reach a disused railway arch on New Mill Road you have passed Thurstonland Bank!!
The first half of this climb is the difficult part as it reaches 14% for about four hundred yards.
After a sharp left hand bend the gradient slackens to between 10% and 6.5% before
levelling out after half a mile of climbing. Through the last one hundred yards it rises again,
but not drastically, before finishing outside the Rose and Crown on your left as you reach
the village of Thurstonland. Time for another drink perhaps!!
