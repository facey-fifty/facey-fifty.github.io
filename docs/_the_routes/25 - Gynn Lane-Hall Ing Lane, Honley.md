Gynn Lane can be found approximately one hundred yards further along the A616 New Mill
Road from climb No) 24. The first two hundred yards are flat before the gentle increase of
the gradient, pass under the railway arch and here the road changes its name to Hall Ing
Lane. The road stays fairly flat before kicking up sharply and continues to climb past the
housing until you reach a short flattish section. Then the road passes a telephone box where
the gradient increases to around 13%. You will pass through a wooded section, which can be
quite slippery, and come to a crossroad where you have to give way. Once you have done
that, continue straight across and up the climb until the road opens up with fabulous views.
The finish is where the road crests and the wood is on your left and open countryside on
your right.
