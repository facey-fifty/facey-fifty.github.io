Start at the junction with A62, which is on your left one hundred yards passed the Mountain
Rescue station, as described in previous climb. The first part at “Throstle Nest” is steep
around 12%. Once past the row of houses at Wood Top this section lessens its incline as you
continue up the side of Pule Hill passing the Pule Side club. Pass above the golf course on
your left and now is the chance for the power riders to get into their rhythm with a strong
pedalling action as the gradient is only 6%, all the way to its junction with Mount Road
where you finish this particular climb. Great views are to be had over the Wessenden Valley
reservoirs.
