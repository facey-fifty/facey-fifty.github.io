This climb was used in the summer of 2014 by the Tour de France and on several other
occasions by the Tour of Britain and the Leeds Classic.

It is included in the book by Simon Warren, 100 greatest cycling climbs (No43) and he gives
it a rating of 5 out of 10.

My climb is longer than his in that it starts at the bridge between the church and the cricket
club in Holmbridge. I have done this to include the steep part at first and also allowing you
to savour the spectacle of “The Moss” whilst cycling through Holme Village on your way up.
This is not a particularly steep climb with the worst bits getting up to around 12% but it is a
hard slog for the main body of the climb after you have left the little hamlet of “Lane”.
There are road markings informing you how far it is to go to the top and also you can have a
chance to spot all the graffiti painted on the road to celebrate the Tour de France teams and
riders. You will be able to see the BBC radio mast, which is at the top, either as a beacon of
hope or one of despair as you battle gravity and sometimes the elements. The car park on
the left two hundred yards from the finish will give fabulous views over to Emley Moor
mast and the power stations of Ferrybridge and Drax on a clear day. These views are for you
to enjoy on your return journey and if you are lucky the ice cream van may well be there.

The Holme Valley Wheelers use this final ascent for their winter hill climb. There are some
very fast times on the Strava app for you to compare yourself against others including the
professional riders from the “tour”.
