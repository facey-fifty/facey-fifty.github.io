Go into Slaithwaite and turn left at the roundabout and the climb starts just after the
Shoulder of Mutton public house directly below the church. The road rises very steeply at
first under the railway bridge until it reaches a crossroads where you turn left. Here you get
quite a long respite along Longlands Road but as soon as the road name changes the going
gets tough and just gets tougher!! You pass the Wilberlee Junior School on your right and
then the next section is very tough but there is a real sting for the last two hundred yards
before (what you might think is the top) the road levels out as it follows the contour around
the hillside. Grab a splendid view to your left before the final small amount of climbing up to
the Old Chapel at Scammonden, now residential apartments. You have a choice of two pubs
to grab some refreshments just a matter of yards further over the brow of the hill. Enjoy!!
