> Don’t let the average fool you it’s tough!!

Follow the A616 from Honley towards New Mill and you will find this climb by passing the
Rock Pub on your right immediately after a pedestrian crossing in Brockholes village. Go
onto the next pedestrian crossing where you turn left immediately before it.
Start
by
following
the
road
past
the
church
and
continue
straight
on
at
an
angled
crossroads. The road narrows and bends past the Primary School on your left and then the
gradient increases as you approach the railway line. Don’t turn left to the railway station,
but continue up under the railway bridge. You will now start what I class as one of the
hardest climbs in this book! The surface can be tricky at the best of times but especially if
the road is damp or leaf covered in autumn. It is quite narrow and you may have problems
passing vehicles approaching in the opposite direction. The gradient never gets less than
10% anywhere from the bridge onwards and it reaches 16% for quite long sections. You pass
through a crossroads and then you can virtually see the top where there is a hard finish to
the climb. Once you pass the telephone transmitter you can relax and pedal along the flat to
the crossroads around a quarter of a mile further on. I am sure you will appreciate this
relaxing flat as it will have been a very tough ascent!!
You can just see the mast (top centre) at the top nearly hidden by the trees.
