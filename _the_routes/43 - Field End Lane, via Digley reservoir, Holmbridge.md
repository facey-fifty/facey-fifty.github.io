Follow the West Yorkshire Cycle Route.
This climb starts adjacent to the side of The Bridge Tavern in Holmbridge, west of Holmfirth
on (A6024) and climbs quite steeply at first until it levels off at about the quarter of mile
mark. Continue along this level section. At a junction the main road bends round to the
right, ignore this and continue along the flatter part until you reach a steeper section which
brings you up to the Digley reservoir dam wall. Continue straight on keeping the reservoir
on your left. The road bends round to the right and kicks up very quickly and keeps
increasing in severity through a series of bends until you reach a crossroads where you carry
on up. There is a little respite immediately after this crossroad before the final section
passing Green Gates Farm on your left, finishing when you finally reach the flat section at
the top, only a couple of hundred yards after the farm.
