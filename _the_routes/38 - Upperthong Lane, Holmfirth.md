Leave the traffic lights in Holmfirth towards Greenfield and Holme Moss on the main A6024
road and after one hundred yards turn right up Upperthong Lane between Bloc Cafe and
Ashley Jacksonâ€™s Art gallery. The climb gets progressively steeper up to 12% as you proceed
up the hill. The climb starts in a very narrow road with houses which feel to be leaning onto
you!! Soon afterwards you pass the church and graveyard where it opens up a little. The
gradient increases very slightly keep straight on at the crossroads and after twenty yards
bear right up the steepest bit of road passing the newer housing and eventually arriving at a
flat section allowing you to spin your legs more freely then you will sweep round a left hand
bend and up The Royal Oak public house. Dare I say some refreshements?
