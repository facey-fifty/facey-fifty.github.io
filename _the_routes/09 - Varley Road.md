Again the start is at its junction with the A62 just on the Marsden side of Slaithwaite as you come out of the dip where the Nobles wine-bar/restaurant is situated. This time the surface is beautiful due to it being re-surfaced. The first few yards are quite steep as you sweep left of the A62 but soon slackens to a lovely gradient for sitting down and getting a good cadence rolling. Once you have left the houses behind the gradient gets even less allowing you to really put the pedal down! The climb finishes at the “T” junction with the B6107 Chain Road. This area is known as Holt Head where there was a pub called the White House which has been converted into several houses slightly higher up than the finish. You will visit it at the end of the next climb.
