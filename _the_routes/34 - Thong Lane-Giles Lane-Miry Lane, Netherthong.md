This climb is off the main Huddersfield to Holmfirth road A6024 at Thongsbridge. Turn right
immediately after the pedestrian crossing when proceeding to Holmfirth approximately one
and a half miles from Honley. The first section is steep at around 11% and slackens slightly
to around 9% up into the village of Netherthong. When you pass the school and Clothier’s
Arms pub take the next right down Giles Street and bear right at its junction with Outlane.
Then continue to the bottom ignoring the turns to the right and left. Pass St Mary’s Road on
your right and then start to climb up the narrow section of road up to Oldfield. This section
is hard as it is very steep (15%) and sometimes very slippery due to the overhanging trees
and a horrendous surface. Richard Bishop a friend and training partner used to call this bit
“never hill” because the first time we tackled it after a hard ride we felt taht we never
wanted to climb it again!! But regardless of that we did it plenty more times!!The climb
finishes at the flat section of road with far reaching views
