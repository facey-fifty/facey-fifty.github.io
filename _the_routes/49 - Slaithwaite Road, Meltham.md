The penultimate climb!! It is quite an unremarkable climb in that it is fairly bland, but I have
included it as it is one that we use quite regularly on our Thursday club run.
Find this climb by turning right at the
main
crossroads
in
Meltham
(coming
from
Huddersfield) downhill to the mini roundabout, outside Morrisonâ€™s supermarket, turn left.
This road takes you towards Slaithwaite and Marsden. The first section to the right hand
bend is the steepest but only around 7% and then a very constant 5% for the rest of the
climb passing the Travellers Inn, on your left, on your way to the top, where the finish is, as
the hill crests outside a long drive to a farm on your right hand side. Just one more climb
now to complete the set of fifty!!
