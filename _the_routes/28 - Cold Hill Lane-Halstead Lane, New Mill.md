Again travel along the A616 towards New Mill passing the previous four climbs. Just before
reaching New Mill Centre, where the White Hart public house is situated, turn a very sharp
left back on yourself into Cold Hill Lane. At this junction you will spot a green wooden
hairdressersâ€™ shop slightly set back from the road.
Again the first half mile of this climb is where the gradient is at its fiercest reaching 15% on
the sharp left hand bend which is about one hundred yards before the half mile mark where
the gradient really levels off. After this level section the road rises for a short period to
around 10% and then flattens out right up to the top where the road meets Haw Cliff Lane
on your left. Splendid views are afforded once you reach the finishing stages.
The road surface can be quite poor especially on the sharp left hand steep bend!!
