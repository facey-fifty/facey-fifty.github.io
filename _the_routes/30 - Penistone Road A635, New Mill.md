This main road climb the A635 starts at the crossroads in the centre of New Mill and is
probably the busiest of the few main roads I have chosen. Outside rush hours it isn’t too bad
and it is a wide road so you shouldn’t get too much hassle from drivers!
This climb has a fairly steady and consistent gradient ranging for the most part around the
5%-6% but once past the Crossroads public house at just over one mile the gradient eases to
around 3%. The climb finishes at the next crossroads (Marsh Lane) around three hundred
yards past the pub.
