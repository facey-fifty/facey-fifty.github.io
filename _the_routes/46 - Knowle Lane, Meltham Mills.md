This climb can be found by following the B6108 towards Meltham from Huddersfield.
Approximately one mile before Meltham turn left into Meltham Mills Road, passing the site
of the old David Brown’s tractor factory. When you reach the sharp left hand bend this is
where the climb starts at the junction with Acre Lane. Alternatively it can be found if you are
coming back from the previous climb by returning to the crossroads where the false flat is
and turn left, follow this country road to the next “T” junction turn left and follow this road
to the bottom where the climb starts.
This is a fabulous climb in that is very short but nice and steep! You can give it an all out
effort and feel totally drained at the top but feel the euphoria of the adrenaline coursing
through your veins. Now recover by looking at the beautiful countryside. Enjoy!!
It is steep! All the way up!
