This climb again starts in the centre of New Mill at the junction by the Indian restaurant on
the A616 to Sheffield. This is a nice long climb where the gradient stays fairly constant with
a couple of slightly steeper bits, especially the last quarter of a mile and includes two small
flat sections. It is possible to get a great rhythm going for the majority of this climb. The
wind can be a factor when you get near the top if it is a strong westerly. The finish is at the
site of the old Victoria public house, now a detached house at the crossroads where you will
be more than 1100ft above sea level. Once you have completed the climb, turn round and
descend the climb but donâ€™t forget to take in the magnificent views. Once you get to the
first crossroads which is one hundred yards before the Red Lion public house, turn right to
tackle the next climb.
