Follow the route to the previous climb but instead of turning right up the hill continue for
approximately a quarter of a mile further on. The start of the climb is at its junction with
Crow Trees Road and Kettle Lane adjacent to the railway, don’t turn down under the railway
line continue straight ahead. Again this is a road where if you meet an oncoming vehicle
there is a great probability that you will have to stop and turn round and start again as it is
very narrow in places.

Don’t let the average gradient fool you into thinking that this is an easy hill it is definitely
NOT. It is very tough and difficult terrain in places on your way up to the hamlet of
Slaithwaite Hall including a very tight hairpin bend and your chance to climb some cobbles
which are to the left of centre on the road, though you can be sensible and use the tarmac
at the sides where the gradient is between 16% and 19%. The rest is much less severe. This
climb is part of the West Yorkshire Circular route so just follow the signs. Once you get to
the hamlet the road flattens out and isn’t too much of a challenge after that and only
moderate increases of gradient. Keep an eye out on your left for a field with Wallabies in!!
Yes Wallabies in Slawit!! The climb finishes once again at the Rose and Crown pub, Cop Hill.
